# Candy-Mastermind-2D
I created this game to enhance my skills in Unity and game design. The goal was to make a fun, engaging version of the classic Mastermind game, but with a twist: I replaced the usual boring pegs with a colorful candy theme to make it more exciting.

In this candy-themed version of Mastermind, the computer selects four candies in a specific order, and the playerâ€™s goal is to guess both the candies and their correct order. The Hint Box provides feedback with blue gummy bears to indicate a correct candy in the correct spot, and white gummy bears for a correct candy in the wrong spot. At the end of the game, the player is shown their score, the number of turns they took, the time spent, and a "Try Again" button to start a new round.

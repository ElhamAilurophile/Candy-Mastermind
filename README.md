# Candy-Mastermind-2D
I made this game to improve my skills in Unity and game design.
This game is trying to be fun.  Fundamentally I am trying to achieve a mastermind game with nice art. Not like usual mastermind games with boring pearls.
Mastermind is a code-breaking game with computer and player. Candy theme make this game more fun and interesting. Computer choose four candies and put them in order. Player should guess candies and their order by using Hint Box. In Hint Box blue gummy candy bears represent for a correct candy in a correct place and white ones represent for a correct candy in a wrong place. At the end of the game player will see the result, turns that player played, time that spent, player's score and "Let's Try Again" button for playing again.

I made it with Unity3D but game world that player will see is 2D.
